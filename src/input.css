/*
* These directives import different parts of Tailwind's CSS framework into the project.
* Base styles: 
* - Establish a consistent foundation across different browsers.
* - Normalize styles and set up default font sizes, colors, and other global settings.
* 
* Component styles:
* - Provide ready-to-use component styles that can be applied directly to HTML elements.
* - Facilitate rapid development with pre-styled components, reducing the need for custom CSS.
*
* Utility clases:
* - Offer a wide range of utility classes for fine-tuned control over your design.
* - Enable a utility-first approach to styling, where you apply single-purpose classes directly to HTML elements.
